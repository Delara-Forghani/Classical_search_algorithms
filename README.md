# Classical_search_algorithms
This repository consists of an implementation of all classical search algorithms.
These algorithms are mentioned in chapter 3 of "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" and my implementations are based on the
descriptions of the reference.<br />
<br />
The problem is to traverse the map of Romania from Arad(Source) to Bucharest(destination) using all classical search algorithms.<br />
The map of Romania is stored in input.txt. (The exact shape of the map exists in the reference)<br /> 
There is a class named Problem in which all methods in order to formulate the foregoing problem are implemented. <br/>
Search algorithms are BFS, DFS, Depth-Limited Search, Iterative Deepening DFS, Uniform cost, Greedy best-first search, AStar search.
